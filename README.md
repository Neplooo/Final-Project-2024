# Final-Project-2024
This is a repository of my Final project in my intermediate computer programming class for 2023-2024

- Update 1: I have a complete model that takes data on the color of an object and finds the center of that object. We can track it in this way.

- Update 2: I have encapsulated all code for the Color detection code and created a test protocol to check if the camera is plugged in. (5/1/24)

## To Do's

- Code still needs streamlining.

- A video about the project needs to be made. (Like last year)
